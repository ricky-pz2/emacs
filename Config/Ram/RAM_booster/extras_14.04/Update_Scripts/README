This folder contains scripts that need to run during upgrades (running of rupgrade)

This includes changes that are more complex than just a change to an
existing file in an existing directory. Ex:

	A script file name change
	A change to the main RAM_Booster script that changes anything significant

Any scripts here will:

	1. Be run EVERY TIME rupgrade runs
	2. Be automatically made executable using chmod
	3. Only run if they have a .sh extension
	4. Be considered to have errored out by rupgrade if they exit
		with any non-zero exit code

This means that ALL scripts in this folder MUST check to see if the
changes they are going to be making have already been made, and if so,
do nothing (exit with exit code 0)

Any scripts here can also print output to stdout or stderr, but it's preferrable to:

	1. Only write one line of output, indicating success, failure,
		or the fact that changes were previously applied so
		there was no need to apply them again
	2. Indent the line with one tab

See "Developer Notes" file for the update strategy, which describes
	when these scripts are to be used
