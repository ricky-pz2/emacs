#Description:
#	If a kernel update occurs through redit or rupdate, RAM
#	Session's grub entry will immediately be modified to use the
#	new kernel. If a squashfs image with the updated modules is not
#	created immediately (at least before a reboot), the RAM Session
#	will be forced to use a kernel it has no modules for. This
#	creates a file called /WARN in the RAM Session that redit and
#	rupdate can detect, and warn people to recreate the squashfs image

if [[ -e /RAM_Session ]]
then
	sudo touch /WARN
fi
